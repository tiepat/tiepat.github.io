Duckuino
Live version here: https://tiepat.github.io/

DuckyScript -> Arduino converter/compiler + HID mouse emulation.

```diff
- DEPENDENCY: https://github.com/NicoHood/HID (*IMPORTANT!*)
```
Download HID-Project from: https://github.com/NicoHood/HID/archive/master.zip and add it to Arduino Library.

If you got any problems with the keyboard layout (if you don't have a QWERTY keyboard) then use the library that Thecakeisgit has created: https://github.com/Thecakeisgit/LocaleKeyboard.js

If you don't want to use the mouse emulation then use Thecakeisgit's compiler: https://github.com/Thecakeisgit/Dckuino.js

NOTE: You should update the Arduino IDE to the latest version for better cross-platform compatibility! (Or use the Arduino Create Web IDE)

Commands: https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Duckyscript

Commands are mostly the same, but since I am in the United States I have changed it so it is US keyboard style. This means no mouse commands.
